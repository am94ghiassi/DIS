We are the Distributed Intelligent Systems Lab at the Distributed Systems Section, EWI faculty, TU Delft. 
We are a newly established lab and work on a wide variety of research problems in distributed machine learning systems.

<br> 
<br>

Out lab is supported by TU Delft, Aegon, ABB Research, Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), and Dutch National Science Foundation (NWO) to our group.
